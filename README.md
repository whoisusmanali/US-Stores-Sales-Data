# US-Stores-Sales-Data
In this project I use different python libraries. Firstly, I clean the data by removing duplicates, null values and do some statically analysis. Secondly, I remove all the outliers from the data set. Thirdly, I use plotly for EDA. Lastly, I make dummies and store the whole data into a csv.
